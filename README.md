# Generative Poem
Developed in April, 2024.

## Tech Stack
React app using Typescript.

## Concept
I use a randomization algorithm to capture my real-time mental dialogue, in turn creating a novel poetry format. The poem expresses my feelings about having a different first language than my partner. When the page is clicked, the text switches into Mandarin as a way to bridge this language barrier.

## Display
This piece was shown on [The Void](https://www.instagram.com/thevoiduvic/), located in the University of Victoria. It was installed on a smart monitor with a mouse on a plinth, allowing viewers to interact with the poem themselves.
