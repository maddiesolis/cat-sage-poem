# Generative Poem
Developed in April, 2024.

## Tech Stack
React app using Typescript.

## Concept
I use a randomization algorithm to capture my real-time mental dialogue, in turn creating a novel poetry format. The poem expresses my feelings about having a different first language than my partner. When the page is clicked, the text switches into Mandarin as a way to bridge this language barrier.
